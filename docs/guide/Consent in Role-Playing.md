#### Understanding Consent

1. **What is Consent?**
	 * Consent in role-playing is the agreement between players about the actions and themes they are comfortable exploring together. It's crucial for creating a safe and enjoyable gaming experience.

2. **Types of Consent**
	 *  **Explicit Consent**: Verbal or written agreement before proceeding with an action. For example, asking directly if a player is okay with a specific scene.
	 * **Implicit Consent**: Implied through previous actions or established boundaries but still requires confirmation. For instance, if players have previously agreed on certain types of interactions.

#### Guidelines for Consent

1. **Communication**
	 * Use OOC (Out of Character) channels to discuss boundaries and comfort levels. For example, you might say: `ooc I'm okay with combat, but I'd prefer if we avoided detailed descriptions of injuries.`

2. **Respect Boundaries**
	 * Always honor a player's boundaries. If a player says they're uncomfortable with a particular theme, steer the scene in a different direction. For instance, if someone says `ooc I'm not comfortable with this topic,` respond with `ooc No problem, let's change the scene.`

3. **Checking In**
	 * During intense or sensitive scenes, check in with your fellow players to ensure everyone is comfortable. Use phrases like `ooc Are you okay with this?` or `ooc Do you want to continue this scene?`

#### Role-Playing Scenarios and Consent

1. **Physical Interactions**
	 * Before initiating a fight scene, ask: `ooc Are you comfortable with our characters getting into a fight?` If they agree, you can proceed with the scene, but if not, find an alternative action that everyone is comfortable with.
	 * Avoid dictating outcomes for other characters. Instead of writing `act reaches out and wraps their hand around [target's name]'s throat`, write `act reaches out and tries to grab [target's name] by the throat`, allowing the target to dictate the outcome.

2. **Emotional and Psychological Themes**
	 * Before exploring a character's traumatic past, ask: `ooc Is it okay if we delve into your character's backstory involving their family?` This allows the player to set limits on how deep the exploration should go.

3. **Romantic and Intimate Scenes**
	 * Before initiating a romantic scene, ask: `ooc Are you comfortable with a romantic interaction between our characters?` Ensuring mutual consent helps maintain comfort and trust among players.

4. **Permanent Character Kills**
	 * Permanent character kills must always be the victim's decision. No aggressor can dictate the outcome by saying "I kill [target's name]." The victim must choose if they are going to let their character die.

#### Handling Consent Violations

1. **Recognizing Violations**
	 * If a player expresses discomfort during a scene, stop immediately and address their concerns. For example, if someone says `ooc I'm not okay with this,` respond with `ooc Let's pause and discuss what we can change.`

2. **Reporting and Resolution**
	 * If a violation occurs, report it to the moderators or administrators. Use the appropriate in-game commands or contact methods, such as joining the [[Discord]] and messaging a moderator. Explain the situation clearly and respectfully.

#### Creating a Culture of Consent

1. **Setting Expectations**
	 * Discuss consent and boundaries with all players when necessary. Establish a mutual understanding and agreement on what is acceptable. For example, `ooc Let's talk about our comfort levels and boundaries before we start.`

2. **Leading by Example**
	 * Experienced players and moderators should model consent-seeking behavior. If you're an experienced player, demonstrate how to ask for consent and respect boundaries. For instance, `ooc I usually check in during intense scenes to make sure everyone is okay. It's important to keep the game enjoyable for everyone.`

#### Player Agency in Outcomes

In role-playing interactions, ensure that all players maintain control over their characters' experiences and responses. This practice respects each player's autonomy and enhances collaborative storytelling.

1. **Initiating Actions**
	 * When you want to take an action involving another character, describe your attempt without specifying the outcome. For example:
		 * Instead of: `act reaches out and wraps their hand around [target's name]'s throat`
		 * Use: `act reaches out and tries to grab [target's name] by the throat`

2. **Responding to Actions**
	 * If you are the target of an action, you get to decide how your character responds. You can choose to allow the action to succeed, partially succeed, or fail, based on what makes sense for your character. For example:
		 * If you agree with the action: `act gets grabbed by the throat, gasping in surprise.`
		 * If you want to avoid the action: `act ducks quickly, dodging the attempt to grab their throat.`

#### Recognizing Non-Verbal Cues

Even in a text-based role-playing environment, non-verbal cues can be essential. Players might not always explicitly state their discomfort.

1. **Signs of Discomfort**
	 * Players might show discomfort through hesitation, vagueness, or abrupt changes in their responses. Pay attention to these signs and check in if you notice them.

2. **Respecting Silence**
	 * If a player goes silent or stops responding, it might indicate discomfort. Use OOC communication to check in: `ooc Are you okay with continuing this scene?`

#### Safe Words and Phrases

To ensure players feel safe and can quickly indicate discomfort, consider implementing safe words or phrases that players can use to pause or stop the game.

1. **Common Safe Words**
	 * **"Pause"**: Indicates that the player needs a break to discuss something OOC.
	 * **"Stop"**: Indicates that the player is uncomfortable and wants to end the current scene.

2. **Using Safe Words**
	 * Encourage players to use these words without fear of judgment. If someone says "Pause" or "Stop," immediately halt the scene and address their concerns.

#### Positive Reinforcement

Encouraging positive reinforcement can create a more supportive and inclusive environment.

1. **Complimenting Good Role-Play**
	 * After a scene, use OOC to compliment other players: `ooc That was a fantastic scene! I loved how you played your character's reaction.`

2. **Encouraging Consent Discussions**
	 * Reinforce the importance of consent by acknowledging when players check in: `ooc I appreciate you checking in about that scene. It made it more enjoyable for me.`

#### Healthy Boundary Setting

Show players how to set and respect boundaries in a positive and constructive manner.

1. **Setting Boundaries**
	 * `ooc I'm okay with action scenes, but I'd prefer to avoid graphic violence.`
	 * `ooc I'm comfortable with romantic interactions, but let's keep it PG.`

2. **Respecting Boundaries**
	 * If a player sets a boundary, acknowledge it and adjust the scene accordingly: `ooc Got it. We'll keep the fight scene non-graphic.`
