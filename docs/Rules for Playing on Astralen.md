Welcome to Astralen! To ensure a fun and respectful environment for all players, please follow these rules:

#### 1. Respect and Courtesy

 * 1.1 **Be Respectful**: Treat all players with respect and courtesy. Harassment, bullying, or discriminatory behavior will not be tolerated.
 * 1.2 **No Hate Speech**: Any form of hate speech, including racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise offensive remarks, is strictly prohibited.

#### 2. Role-Playing Etiquette

 * 2.1 **Stay In-Character (IC)**: Use the appropriate commands for in-character interactions. Avoid mixing IC and OOC (Out of Character) communication.
 * 2.2 **Use OOC for Out of Character Communication**: Use the `ooc`, `looc`, and `gooc` commands for out-of-character conversations. Respect others' immersion by keeping OOC comments to a minimum in IC areas.

#### 3. Consent and Boundaries

 * 3.1 **Seek Consent**: Always seek consent before engaging in intense or sensitive role-playing scenarios. Use OOC communication to check in with other players.
 * 3.2 **Respect Boundaries**: Honor the boundaries set by other players. If someone expresses discomfort, adjust the scene accordingly.
 * 3.3 **No Forced Outcomes**: Do not dictate outcomes for other characters. Allow the target player to decide how their character responds to actions.

#### 4. Combat and Conflict

 * 4.1 **Use Dice Rolls for Combat**: Use the `dice` commands to resolve combat scenarios. Ensure both parties agree on the terms before proceeding.
 * 4.2 **Non-Lethal Combat**: Keep combat non-lethal unless all parties agree otherwise. Permanent character kills must be the victim's decision.

#### 5. Player Conduct

 * 5.1 **No Cheating**: Exploiting game mechanics, using cheats, or manipulating the game in unfair ways is prohibited.
 * 5.2 **No Spamming**: Avoid spamming commands or flooding the chat with excessive messages.

#### 7. Reporting Issues

 * 7.1 **Report Violations**: Report any rule violations to the moderators or administrators. Use in-game commands or join the [Discord](#) to contact a moderator.
 * 7.2 **Provide Details**: When reporting an issue, provide as much detail as possible to help moderators address the problem effectively.

 * 8.2 **Ask for Help**: If you have questions or need assistance, use the `help` command or reach out to a moderator on Discord.

### Example Scenarios and Guidelines

#### Example of Seeking Consent

**Before a Combat Scene**:

- **Player A**: `ooc Are you comfortable with our characters getting into a fight?`
- **Player B**: `ooc Yes, but let's keep it non-lethal.`

**Before Exploring a Dark Theme**:

- **Player A**: `ooc Are you okay with exploring a darker theme for this storyline?`
- **Player B**: `ooc I'm okay with it, but let's avoid anything too graphic.`

#### Example of Expressing Discomfort

**If a Player Expresses Discomfort**:

- **Player A**: `act draws a dagger and threatens [target's name].`
- **Player B**: `ooc I'm not comfortable with this threatening scene.`
- **Player A**: `ooc No problem, let's change the scene.`
- **Player A**: `act lowers the dagger and takes a step back, reconsidering.`


By following these rules, we can create a welcoming and enjoyable environment for everyone in Astralen. Thank you for your cooperation and happy role-playing!
